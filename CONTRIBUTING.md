## Code Style and Code Conventions

The code written in [Golang](https://golang.org/) in this repository tries to follow the rules set by the community for this topic.

A summary of the introductory recommendations can be found in [CodeReviewComments wiki topic](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments), a more complete version can be found in [Effective Go article](https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html). Additional guidance on how to write good code can be found in the article [How to Write Go Code](https://golang.org/doc/code.html).

## Dependency Management

In addition, to manage possible dependencies this project uses [govendor](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor). Modifications on the dependencies must be submitted with the pull request on file `vendor/vendor.json`. Instructions as govendor works can be found [here](https://github.com/kardianos/govendor).

## Commit message pattern

- Use imperatively ("Add feature" no "Adding feature" or "Added feature").
- First line should have a maximum of 72 characters.
- Consider describe in detail in the body commits.
- Consider using an emoji at the start of the commit message.
